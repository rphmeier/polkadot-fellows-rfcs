## Polkadot and Kusama Fellowship RFCs

This repository contains a number of Requests for Comment (RFCs) detailing changes to the runtime and node behavior of these networks. This repository is not a final source of truth for the logic of these networks, as they are meta-protocols with their own hosted governance systems for determining their own destiny. These RFCs are for the discussion and design of features which have been submitted for consideration to the developer fellowships of these networks, as well as targets for the fellowships' on-chain bodies to signal approval or disapproval of.

TODO: pending RFC-0001 to describe some processes for on-chain bodies to interact with the repository.
